Gestalt principles: figure-ground segregation, group by similarity and proximity, law of good continuation, closure
Merkel's disk: detects light pressure
Pacinian corpuscle: detects transient pressure and high frequecy vibration
Ruffini corpuscle: detects stretch and body position
Meissner's corpuscle: detects pressure and low frequency vibration
nociceptor: receptors that detect pain
proprioception: perception of body position
Inferior colliculus: the principal midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway and receives input from several peripheral brainstem nuclei in the auditory pathway, as well as inputs from the auditory cortex.
Organ of Corti: The organ of Corti, or spiral organ, is the receptor organ for hearing and is located in the mammalian cochlea.
Presbycusis: Presbycusis (also spelled presbyacusis, from Greek presbys), or age-related hearing loss, is the cumulative effect of aging on hearing
Stereocilia: In the inner ear, stereocilia are the mechanosensing organelles of hair cells, which respond to fluid motion in numerous types of animals for various functions, including hearing and balance.
Three membrane structure in the cochlea: basilar membrane, tectorial membrane, organ of Corti
Exteroceptive: Exteroceptive senses are senses that perceive the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses.
Interoceptive: Interoceptive senses are senses that perceive sensations in internal organs
Mechanoreceptor: A mechanoreceptor is a sensory receptor that responds to mechanical pressure or distortion
five basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, unami
olfactory path: olfactory sensory receptor on nasal ephithelium -> glomerulus -> mitral cell -> olfactory bulb
gustatory path: taste receptors in taste buds around papillae-> 
endogenous orienting: occurs when attention is oriented according to an observer's goals or desires, allowing the focus of attention to be manipulated by the demands of a task.
exogenous orienting: considered to be reflexive and automatic and is caused by a sudden change in the periphery
